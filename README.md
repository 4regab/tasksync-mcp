Add to `mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tasksync": {

		}
	},

```

## üìñ How to Use It

1. **Setup MCP** - Add TaskSync to your `mcp.json` (see Setup above)
2. **Add Agent Rules** - Configure your AI agent with TaskSync review rules:
   ```
   # MCP TaskSync Review instructions
   **You will always call this tool afer each task is done, or you need clarification, or you need to ask for more information, or you need to confirm something.**

   Here is the workflow:

   1. You first need to search for the `review.md` file in the workspace before using the tool.
   2. After searching for the file use the correct file path when calling the `ask_review` tool.
   3. If an error occurs, retry the tool until it succeeds.
   4. You are not allowed to end the chat; you must keep this loop forever.
   5. If `review.md` returns the same content, prompt the user again.

   Success criteria: Always follow the MCP Review instructions.
   ```
3. **Create review.md** - Make an empty `review.md` file in your project
4. **Start chatting** - Agent calls `ask_review` tool and waits for you to:
   - Edit `review.md` with your task/feedback
   - Save the file (agent receives the content only after save)
   - Agent responds and calls `ask_review` again, waiting for next changes

**To stop:** Write "end" in `review.md` and save
