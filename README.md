# TaskSync MCP Server

 TaskSync provides tools for interactive user feedback and command execution in AI-assisted development with image view support.

## üåü Key Features

#### üîÑ Continuous Review Feedback
- **get_feedback** tool that reads `feedback.md` for real-time feedback
- Automatically creates `feedback.md` if it doesn't exist in the workspace
- File watcher automatically detects changes and notifies waiting processes
- Essential for iterative development and user feedback loops

#### üñºÔ∏è Media Processing
- **view_media** tool for images files with base64 encoding
- Supports image formats: PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, BMP, SVG
- Efficient streaming for large files with proper MIME type detection

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

Add to `mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tasksync": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "tasksync-mcp@latest", "/path/to/directory"]
    }
  }
}
```

For VS Code:
```json
{
	"servers": {
    "tasksync": {
      "command": "npx",
		"type": "stdio",
      	"args": ["-y", "tasksync-mcp@latest", "/path/to/directory"]
    }
  }
}
```

## üìñ How to Use It

1. **Setup MCP** - Add TaskSync MCP server to your `mcp.json` (you must configure the path to directory or workspace)
2. **Add Agent Rules** - Configure your AI agent with TaskSync feedback rules:
	```
	# MCP TaskSync Server Tool Rules
	
	Strictly follow mcp_tasksync_get_feedback tool descriptions and instructions.
	```
3. **Create review.md** - Make an empty `review.md` file in your project
4. **Start chatting** - Agent calls `get_feedback` tool and waits for you to:
   - Edit `feedback.md` with your task/feedback
   - Save the file (agent receives the content only after save)
   - Agent responds and calls `get_feedback` again, waiting for next changes
   - **To stop:** Write "end" in `feedback.md` and save
