## üõü Best Practices

### Agent Rules for Optimal Performance

For best results with TaskSync, add these rules to your AI agent configuration:

```
# MCP TaskSync Review Rules

1. You first need to search for the `review.md` file in the workspace before using the tool.
2. After searching for the file use the correct file path when calling the `ask_review` tool.
3. If an error occurs, retry the tool until it succeeds.
4. You are not allowed to end the chat; you must keep this loop forever.
5. If `review.md` returns the same content, prompt the user again.

Success criteria: Always follow the MCP TaskSync instructions.
```

These rules ensure continuous feedback loops and proper error handling.
